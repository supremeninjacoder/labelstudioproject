Implementing Progressive Learning In Label Studio Using River ML Model

Introduction
River is a Python library for real-time machine learning. It is the outcome of the fusion between creme and scikit-multiflow. River aims to be the primary library for conducting machine learning on streaming data.

Label Studio is an open-source data annotation tool for tagging and exploring various data types. It supports diverse labeling tasks with multiple data formats.

What we have accomplished in this project?
Utilization of Label Studio for data annotation with Label Studio ML backend.
Integration of the River Python library to facilitate progressive learning in Label Studio.
Text classification employing the naive_bayes MultinomialNB algorithm.
To execute this project, follow these instructions:
Clone the GitHub project.

Note: First, create a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

Install the required packages.
pip install -r requirements.txt
Initiate the Label Studio.
$ label-studio start
Visit localhost:8080 in the browser and create a new task.
